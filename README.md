## Description

This application provides a user with a clean, straightforward webpage that allows for creating, saving and deleting notes. Built using Express with node.js, my primary challenge in writing its code came while trying to make a working delete route, although by repurposing code from the GET and POST routes, I was able to fashion a solid DELETE route before too long.
